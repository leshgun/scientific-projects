### Functions for counting the number of rational point of the elliptic curve "E".

*a*, *b* are the coefficients of the elliptic curve *E: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b*, 
given over the field *Fq*, where *q* != 2, 3 - is prime. 
The function implements the Baby Step - Giant Step counting algorithm
*Fq* â€“ rational points on the curve, and returns #*E(Fq)*.
